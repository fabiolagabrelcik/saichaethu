                            <p>Every year or so, I tell myself that it's time to give Linux a serious try. This year, I decided to make a serious effort. I picked Ubuntu really just because I knew it existed and figured it was as good as any for getting familiar with the OS, especially for someone coming from Windows. I thought my experience might be useful for others contemplating such a move and particularly for helping to shape one's expectations. tl;dr - it works well, but it doesn't "just work." It takes. https://imgur.com/xpgPvQI (https://imgur.com/xpgPvQI) I am trying to run Unity3D on Elementary Juno which is (basically) Ubuntu 18.04 underneath with the Pantheon desktop environment as the UI. When I run Unity, I get the screen to open a project and everything seems normal. However, after selecting a project (or creating a new one), the Unity window appears, but the actual editor screen does not load in the window. The screenshot above shows what I am talking about. In the scree. Hello! I have a problem with my audio, since i switched my motherboard, because my old one got damaged. As stated in the title my Sound starts to crackle when I am playing a game. This problem appears most common in Overwatch or other graphic intensiv games, after playing 3 - 4 min. According to LatencyMon, the nvlddmkm.sys driver has a high DPC when I play a game or switch tabs with Alt + Tab. The symptoms are the following: \+ Audio crackling / stuttering (On the whole pc for 6 min. after. I'm still on Linux Mint 18.3, but I want to know if Wayland is properly and fully usable in Linux Mint yet? My current install of Linux Mint 18.3 isn't particularly good even though I have all the recent updates and drivers and such installed, one very important thing that bugs me the most is the display lags like shit from doing the simplest of things like dragging windows, or playing a regular 720p video from YouTube in both normal view and Full Screen mode, and this is an ongoing issue Hello!

The symptoms are the following: \+ Audio crackling / stuttering (On the whole pc for 6 min. after. Forewarning: this works very well with nvidia but not very well with amd graphics. Why should I play Counter-Strike Global Offensive on linux? When properly configured, performance is usually improved over windows. Sometimes it blows windows performance away. Mumble and ventrilo are supported (Ventrilo replacement is called Mangler). The main reason for switching to linux is OpenGL. Using OpenGL over DirectX takes care of the feeling that ruined CS:Source and makes CS:GO not quite. 
Operating System ================== Windows 10 Computer Specs (PSU, GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard) ================== PSU - 1000w GPU - MSI 980TI not overclocked. CPU - i7 4771 built in turbo but not overclocked RAM - 16gig DDR3 Motherboard - MSI MS-7818 DXDIAG ================== ( display - ( Description of problem ================== FPS drops from 60-25ish as soon as games finish loading(. Hey all, sorry if this question is not meant for this subreddit. I have a laptop I have been using as a minecraft and web server to code my projects on. It's an Acer 7738G laptop that apparently has a known faulty gpu where what I believe is called Powermizer can freeze your machine when it tries to switch gpu's. I had Windows installed on it previously and every time it needed a reboot I had to keep rebooting it for the random chance that it wouldn't freeze on the "Windows is Starting". Sorry if this has already been covered, I searched and couldn't find a solution, just others with the same issue. I've used Windows 7 since 2008, then Windows 8 for a few months before now, with Windows 10 since release. 7/8 never gave me a problem, but 10 is giving me such high DPC latency, that audio is stuttering and I start to hear crackling when gaming but only briefly. It's almost 100% Network related. I used LatencyMon to take a look, and pinpointed it to my network driver. 
SteamOS has your GPU set to adaptive power mode by default. This means your game will stutter whenever the GPU decides to underclock itself to save power. Here's how to set it to maximum performance and get more FPS. Step 1: Enable Linux Desktop. This article describes how to do it: Step 2: Install Nvidia Settings. Switch to the Linux desktop, then open up a terminal by hitting Alt+F2, typing the command "xterm" OTHERWISE, I love this device. Everything is so easy to use, I love the interface, Netflix works great even over 3G, the speaker sounds AWESOME, I love the keyboard.
